        This is India's most followed News application founded in 1997. It completely depends on the way the front page
        of a newspaper looks to decide if a reader would pick it up or not. So, if you have been thinking of printing a
        newspaper for your personal or business purposes, make sure that you get a perfect front page for it. Newspaper
        front page templates would give you enough ideas as to how you can dress it up.

        Unlike some newspapers, this template leaves adequate empty space in between to go easy on the eyes. The
        headlines are written in a bold fashion which immediately catches our attention.
